> This script is not ready for use currently. It's under heavy development while requirements are defined.

This repo is used to track a POC for a NLP application which takes a block of text and outputs keywords which represent

### Origin of the [`skills.txt`](/sample-data/skills.txt) file
As per [**helpfulengineering/tool-experience-tagger#3**](https://github.com/helpfulengineering/tool-experience-tagger/issues/3):
> The file was a static output from a Linkedin Skills dump provided by Kaggle.

A possible alternative would be [varadchoudhari/LinkedIn-Skills-Crawler/output/all_skills.txt](https://github.com/varadchoudhari/LinkedIn-Skills-Crawler/blob/master/output/all_skills.txt)
